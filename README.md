# Install Web Server

Feel free to use your own web server, but for convenience we've bundled a basic node server. To use it, make sure you have Node/NPM/Yarn

1. yarn install
2. node server.js

Then go to http://localhost:8080

# Design guidelines

We are providing a [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/COBm901fdZV01l8t0MRwIH/AuBook?node-id=2%3A21) of a design for you to follow. The design includes 2 key features:
- Header that shrinks upon initial scrolling, and then remains fixed
- List of books with their cover image, title, and author

If you want to add more functionality/elements (for example, a search bar, pagination, or transitions), that's totally fine and up to you, but not required.

# What we're looking for

We will evaluate your HTML, CSS, and Javascript based on, but not limited to, the following criteria:

- How close is the UI to the provided design?
- Is it performant?
- Is it appropriately responsive at all breakpoints?
- Were UI interaction choices sensible?
- Is the code efficient?
- Is the code easy to read?
- Is the code maintainable?
- Is the code well tested?
- Does it have any bugs?

Remember that this exercise is about _building a product_, and not just _writing code_.

Also, note that there are some deliberate poor design/coding choices that have been made in the original code. It is expected that you will improve upon them.  

### Requirements

- Vanilla JS - no jQuery, no React, no frameworks, no external libraries.
- Use a CSS framework (e.g. Tailwind or Bootstrap would be fine)
- Please provide commentary on changes and reasoning (in-code or separately)

### Time limit

You are free to spend any amount of time **up to 3 hours**. When submitting, please indicate how long you worked on it. We will be assessing balance between polish and execution speed. 

### Submission

Please send us a zip file of the project through your preferred file sharing application, or fork the repository and share that with us.
